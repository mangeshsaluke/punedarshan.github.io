       <b> Q. 1) What Exactly Is Our Project About ?</b> <br>
        Ans. <br> Pune has many places for tourism. So our idea is to provide all the information of these places at one sight.
         We are not only providing textual information, but we have actually visited those places. 
         We have recorded a video which  has location, history, main attractions and much more information about that particular place.
          That is, we are providing people with a small video tour of places in and around Pune.

<b>Q. 5) Which platform did we use to host our project and what was the process involved?</b> <br>
Ans. <br>
After surfing through various platforms, we decided to publish our web project on this platform. We chose this platform because it was easy to use 
and a well known platform. <br>
We started the process with opening an account on this particular platform. Then we created a repository for our files. There we logged in using the 
credentials. We uploaded all our files in the repository and then we were done!
