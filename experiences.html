        <h2>Learnt To Work In a Team</h2> 
        Working with my group not only gave me a chance to understand and learn the team working culture but also to know more about
         my group members. The qualitative attributes like problem-solving approach, communication,  motivation and co-operation helped
          us accomplish our objectives to the fullest. Every member was given an equal opportunity to put forth their ideas and views and
           we proceeded cumulatively. It was indeed a great learning experience and a completely different exposure!
         Looking forward to apply the skills which I have gained from our work in the future and emerge with flying colours!!

<h2>Enhanced Communication Skills</h2>
My experience of working with such a great team was just amazing! With this project, my communication skills are developed alot. 
I considered talking infront of camera to be a difficult task, but I felt really very confident by the end of project. All the members used the opportunities
to its fullest extent to develop their skills. This project helped me to know how to manage the project in a team.

<h2>Got An Insight Into The Technical Skills</h2>
The Pune Darshan Group project was a great opportunity to help fellow visitors.
 It involved learning a lot of new things, some basic and some advanced. 
I also got an insight into the technical skills put into use, like content creation, video editing and web development. 
Learning several soft skills like speaking with confidence, body language, democratic decision making and critical thinking was the cherry on the cake.
 Getting to know my team mates better and bonding over interests mutual to each member of the group was an added bonus.
 The moments shared among us were very invaluable and will be cherished forever by me.

 <h2>Learnt Time Management</h2>
 I got a chance to work with team with such a great members who were always ready to take any responsibility.
  I learnt how to manage time for visiting different places. I knew very little about pune but as we went to different historical places for our project,  
  I got to know a lot about the history of Pune.

 <h2>Amazing Journey With My Collegues</h2>
 It was an amazing journey working with my colleagues throughout the project as
  cooperation and mutual understanding was perfect which is the most essential thing in any group activity.
  It was fun working with them and I learnt many things from them too.
  The project taught me how to deal with various situations in public while visiting the sites we covered. I also learnt basic video editing. 
 The project will be a memorable one and looking forward for more projects with the team mates.

<h2> Understood What The Teamwork Really Means</h2>
No doubt it was a fabulous experience while working with all team members. But what stikes me more is that, everyone in the group had 
their own say and were confident in putting infront. To speak about my technical takeaways, I studied about HTM and CSS and implemented them in the design 
of our project. I learnt about hosting a website. All these skills are going to be great helpful in all upcoming projects. 
From brainstorming about the project idea to making all the content public, the experience was just amazing!
